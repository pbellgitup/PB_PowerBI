# **WELCOME**

This repo is for sample Power BI and other data analytics projects that were put together to showcase some the skills and abilities I can bring to an organization.

I started this repo on 12/17/2024, so if it's a little light on content, give me time *(or it means I'm working on other stuff that I can't upload publicly)*.

Let me know if you find this useful or have any further questions.

## Uploaded Project Descriptions:

### *Job Search Activity Dashboard_20241216 v1.0*
This is a Power BI report that uses an Excel worksheet to track job search activities as required by the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC).  It shows activities per week, along with details related to the jobs applied to, such as company, job title, and a display of jobs applied to each week, with a target of 5, as required by TWC.  Update the included Excel worksheet with your own details.  Current data source directory is **C:\Power BI Examples**, so change the path name as needed to use.
